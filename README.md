## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The goal of this project is to build a robust and accurate classifier that can help users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails.

## Background

Email spam is a common nuisance that can clutter inboxes, waste time, and sometimes even pose security risks. To combat this, machine learning models can be employed to automatically detect and filter out spam emails. This project focuses on developing such a model.

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing this classifier consists of a collection of labeled emails. It includes both spam and ham emails, each labeled accordingly. The data has been preprocessed to extract relevant features from the emails, such as word frequency, presence of certain keywords, and other linguistic features.

## Model

The classification model used in this project is a logistic regression model. It has been trained on a large and diverse dataset to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and ham emails.
